# ElevenPlus
An interactive question and answer learning aid for children preparing for their eleven plus exams. <br />
Main file is 'Controller.java'.

My 2nd year university project for 'CO2001: User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction' module. This project required me to focus on a GUI that was suitable for children of ages 10 and 11, as reflected upon in my report.
